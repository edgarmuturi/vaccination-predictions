Phase 3 Project Notebook
This notebook contains analysis of vaccination data for the H1N1 vaccine and creation of machine learning models to predict uptake of the vaccine.

# BUSINESS PROBLEM AND UNDERSTANDING
The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic that swept throughout the world from late 2019 to late 2021 was a huge shock to the globe. According to the World Health Organization, there have been about 780 million cases and over 7 million deaths from COVID-19. 

The development of vaccines against the coronavirus went a long way in preventing further morbidity and mortality from this disease. Vaccines have also played a tremendous role in the control of various diseases, including measles and polio. Currently, there are multiple global efforts championing for vaccination of young girls (age 9-15) against the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), which is the cause of cervical cancer. The aim is to eradicate cervical cancer from the globe by the year 2099.

Despite the development and availability of COVID vaccines from multiple sources (e.g Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna) there have been challenges with uptake of the vaccines. There is a lot of myths and misconceptions about vaccine side effects that make people avoid taking these vaccines despite lack of scientific evidence to substantiate these claims. As such, vaccine-preventable diseases can end up slowly making a comeback and reversing the gains made.

# PROJECT GOAL
This project aims to predict whether people got H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines using data collected in the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey.

An understanding of how people's backgrounds, opinions and health behaviours are related to their personal vaccination patterns can provide guidance to the World Health Organization to guide vaccination initiatives worldwide.

Stakeholder: World Health Organization Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals

# PROJECT PIPELINE
The following steps were taken:
1. Data preparation - Importation of necessary libraries and loading the data
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Creation of machine learning models
5. Conclusion
6. Recommendations

# Repository Contents
This repository contains:

1. A Jupyter notebook (notebook.ipynb).
2. Testing and training data files.
3. README.md file (the file you are reading now)
4. Powerpoint presentation summarizing the project

# Data Source
The testing and training data was obtained from: (DrivenData. (2020). Flu Shot Learning: Predict H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines. Retrieved [10/7/2025] from https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning.)
